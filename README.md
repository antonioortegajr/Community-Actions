# Community Actions Site

This repo is the website for community actions.

Community Actions is a group of developers and collaborators Looking to solve city and community issues with existing technologies. These technologies often are not known or not understood enough to implement. Additionally the cost of hiring a developer to create a custom technology may not be in the budget.

We want to use existing technologies like frameworks, libraries, and various languages as this allows for rapid development and hopefully is inclusive to more developers that would like to donate time to projects.

Visit the site to see projects we have done or get in contact.



This site is using a Jekyll repo that was forked. We didn't create this, but we are using existing technology.
