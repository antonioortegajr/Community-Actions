### The Problem:
The downtown security team known as the Red Caps were in need of a better why of tracking the incidents they help resolve.

### The Solution:
The Downtown Eugene website was already in some use for them. This site was a WordPress site and it was determined there was no need to force a new technology,
a custom plugin for WordPress was developed. This plugin used the existing WP database to store incidents and created a custom WP API endpoint.
